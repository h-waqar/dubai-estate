# Property Module Test Report

This report summarizes the review of the `property` module's backend implementation based on the plan in `gemini/property.md`.

---

## 1. Code Review & Verification

I have reviewed the core files you implemented for the property module's backend logic.

*   `validators/createProperty.validator.ts`: **✅ Verified.** Your implementation is correct. Your use of `z.enum(FurnishingStatus)` aligns with the latest Zod documentation for handling enum-like objects from Prisma.
*   `types/property.types.ts`: **✅ Verified.** The `CreatePropertyInput` type is correctly inferred from the Zod validator.
*   `services/service.ts`: **✅ Verified.** The `createProperty` and `listProperties` functions are implemented correctly, properly using the slug utility and setting default status.
*   `actions/createProperty.ts`: **✅ Verified.** The server action correctly implements the full flow: session check for authorization, form data parsing, Zod validation, and calling the service layer.

**Conclusion:** The backend logic for creating and listing properties appears to be implemented correctly and follows all the patterns outlined in the plan.

## 2. Simulated Test: `GET /api/properties`

As I cannot execute shell commands, I will describe the test I would have run.

**Test:**
Execute a `GET` request to the `http://localhost:3000/api/properties` endpoint.

**Expected Outcome:**
A successful `200 OK` response with a JSON body. 

*   If no properties are in the database, the expected body is an empty array: `[]`.
*   If properties exist, the body would be a JSON array of property objects.

This test would validate that the `listProperties` service and the API route are wired together correctly.

## ✅ Next Step: UI Implementation

The backend foundation is solid. The next logical step is to build the user interface to interact with it.

I recommend you now focus on implementing **`src/modules/property/components/PropertyForm.tsx`**. This will be the true end-to-end test of the `createPropertyAction`, as you can connect the form's `onSubmit` event directly to the server action.
